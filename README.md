## Installation

No extra libraries are required, the code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

**Question 1: Does having a Ph.D. really make you earn more money (in the tech field)?**

**Question 2: Where do Ph.Ds Go, Small Start up or Big Companies?**

**Question 3: What Factors are Associated with High Salary?**



## File Descriptions

The Jupytor notebook file named "Write a Data Science Blog Post" is uploaded here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.



## Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).
